## 🎨 Game Design

### Resource Economy

The game features a balanced resource economy with four types:
- **C** (Commerce): Generated by villages and towns
- **M** (Magic): Generated by shrines and temples  
- **R** (Raw Materials): Generated by camps and roads
- **F** (Food): Generated by farms and fields

### Influence System

Each tile has base influence that changes based on neighbors:
- **Friendly tiles**: Add their base influence to yours
- **Enemy tiles**: Subtract their base influence from yours
- **Neutral tiles**: No effect on influence

Tiles with 0 influence become capturable by opponents.

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Tile Types

2. Specify type, influence, resources, and cost
3. Add appropriate character representation

- Game state synchronization
- Turn management
